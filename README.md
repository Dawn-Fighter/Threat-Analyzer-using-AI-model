# Excalibur: AI Enhanced Cybersecurity Threat Detector

Welcome to **Excalibur**, the cutting-edge AI-powered cybersecurity tool that helps detect and classify phishing, malicious URLs, and files with a combination of VirusTotal and machine learning algorithms.

This project leverages **machine learning** models and **VirusTotal API** for enhanced malware detection and URL safety analysis.

---

## üî• Features

- **URL Scanning**: Scan URLs against VirusTotal‚Äôs database to detect phishing, malicious, or safe URLs.
- **File Hash Scanning**: Scan files by their hash to detect malicious behavior using VirusTotal's API.
- **AI Prediction**: A machine learning model analyzes URLs and classifies them as safe or malicious.
- **Interactive CLI**: The program features an interactive command-line interface that guides users through the process.
- **AI Enhanced Security**: Leverages machine learning to predict URL safety beyond VirusTotal‚Äôs reports.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation and Setup

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dawn-Fighter/excalibur.git
cd excalibur
```

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/MacOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Dependencies**:

- `aiohttp`: Asynchronous HTTP client to interact with the VirusTotal API.
- `pandas`: For handling and processing data.
- `scikit-learn`: Machine learning library for training the URL safety prediction model.
- `pyfiglet`: For ASCII art in the terminal UI.
- `hashlib`: For generating file hashes.

You can install them manually as well:

```bash
pip install aiohttp pandas scikit-learn pyfiglet
```

### Step 4: Get the VirusTotal API Key

Sign up on [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/) to get your API Key. Replace `API_KEY` in the script with your actual key.

## üöÄ Usage

Once you've set up the environment and installed dependencies, you can run the script to start scanning URLs or files.

### Start the Application

Run the following command to start the interactive CLI:

```bash
python excalibur.py
```

### Commands:

1. **Scan a URL:**
    ```bash
    scan_url <url>
    ```
    Example:
    ```bash
    scan_url http://example.com
    ```

2. **Scan a file:**
    ```bash
    scan_file <file_path>
    ```
    Example:
    ```bash
    scan_file /path/to/file.exe
    ```

3. **Exit the Program:**
    ```bash
    exit
    ```
